This is a placeholder for the OG image. In production, you should create a 1200x630px image
with your branding and portfolio information. You can use tools like Canva, Figma, or code-based
solutions like @vercel/og to generate dynamic OG images.

For now, the metadata is configured to use /og-image.png, so rename your actual OG image to
og-image.png and place it in the public folder.
