              Hello! 👋 I'm Aziz, a passionate web developer. Over the past few years, I've been immersed in the world of software development, gaining hands-on experience and honing my skills in creating dynamic and responsive web applications.
            </p>
            <p>
            I'm currently a third year student at <a className="text-decoration-none" href="https://esprit.tn/">ESPRIT</a> pursuing my Computer Science Engineering degree specialized in Data Science. I delve into the depths of data science, exploring the intricacies of algorithms and data structures. My passion for technology extends beyond the academic realm. I'm also a professional Muay Thai fighter, bringing discipline and determination into everything I do.
            </p>
            <p>
              As I look to the future, my goal is to transition from working on projects to making my own projects. I'm driven by the desire to make a meaningful impact in the tech world and create solutions that resonate with users.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>When I'm not on the computer, I enjoy going to gym, motorcycling, and gaming 🥊🏍️🎮</p>
